Safe Haven
A neighborhood watch app that actually makes sense.
Lost your cat? Saw something sketchy? Need help getting home? Post it here. Your neighbors will see it immediately.

 What is Safe Haven?
It's a web app where neighbors share what's happening in real-time.
Think of it as your neighborhood's group chat, but organized. Instead of hundreds of messages flying by, everything is categorized, mapped, and easy to find.
No algorithms deciding what you see. No ads. Just your neighbors and what's happening on your block.

 Why does this exist?
The problem: Something happens in your neighborhood. By the time you hear about it on Nextdoor or the news, it's already old.
The solution: Post it immediately. Everyone sees it. Everyone stays informed.
That's it. That's the app.

How it works: Someone posts → Everyone sees it instantly

Example: Neighbor posts "Suspicious car on Oak Street at 2AM checking door handles." You see it immediately, lock your car, warn others.

Design Philosophy
Clean, not cluttered.
We removed everything that doesn't need to be there. Big text. Lots of space. Clear buttons. No tricks.
Inspired by companies like MetaLab who design products that feel human, not corporate.
Colors:

Stone grays (warm, not cold)
Amber accents (friendly, approachable)
Category colors (red=danger, green=safe, blue=info)

Buttons do what they say. No dark patterns. No manipulation. Click "Submit" and it submits. That's it.

The Core Idea
Technology should help people connect, not replace connection.
Use this app to coordinate. To warn. To ask for help. To offer help.
But then close the app and go talk to your neighbors in person.
That's the goal.
