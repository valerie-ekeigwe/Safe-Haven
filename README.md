# Safe Haven

**Your neighborhood's safety network. Real-time updates when it matters most.**

---

## What is this?

Safe Haven is a web app where neighbors share what's happening right now. Someone trying car doors at 2 AM? Lost cat? Broken wheelchair ramp? Post it and everyone in your neighborhood sees it immediately.

No algorithms. No ads. Just your block.

## The Problem We're Solving

## Design Philosophy

**Clean, not cluttered.** Every element serves a purpose. No dark patterns.

**Fast and honest.** Sub-2-second load times. Buttons do what they say.

**Human-centered.** Built for real people, not engagement metrics.

Inspired by MetaLab's approach: purposeful design that respects users.

## The Goal

Technology should help people connect, not replace connection.

Use Safe Haven to stay informed and coordinate. But then close the app and talk to your neighbors in person.

That's the whole point.

**Stay safe. Stay connected. Stay human.**
